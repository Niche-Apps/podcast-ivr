# 🚂 Railway Deployment Status

## ✅ **Local Testing: SUCCESS**
The Twilio integration is working perfectly locally:
- ✅ Server starts without healthcheck failures
- ✅ TwiML endpoints working correctly  
- ✅ All 15 podcasts configured and ready
- ✅ Audio pipeline generating content
- ✅ No RingCentral dependencies remaining

## ⚠️ **Railway Issue: Auto-Deploy Not Working**

Railway appears to not be automatically deploying the latest code from GitHub pushes. The deployment is still running the old RingCentral version.

### Current Railway Status:
- **Current Response**: Old JSON format without Twilio features
- **Expected Response**: New Twilio format with 15 podcasts
- **Health Check**: `/health` endpoint not found (should return "OK")

## 🛠️ **Manual Railway Deployment Required**

### Option 1: Railway Dashboard
1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**: https://railway.app
2. **Find your project**: `podcast-ivr`
3. **Trigger manual deployment**:
   - Click "Deployments" tab
   - Click "Deploy Now" or "Redeploy"
   - Wait for build to complete

### Option 2: Railway CLI (if installed)
```bash
railway login
railway link
railway deploy
```

### Option 3: Environment Variables Fix
If the deployment is failing due to missing environment variables, add these in Railway dashboard:

```bash
# Required for proper startup
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
PORT=3000

# Optional (for full functionality)
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./google-credentials.json
```

## 🔍 **How to Verify Success**

Once Railway properly deploys, these endpoints should work:

### Health Check
```bash
curl https://podcast-ivr-production.up.railway.app/health
# Should return: "OK"
```

### System Status
```bash
curl https://podcast-ivr-production.up.railway.app/
# Should include: "twilioEnabled": true, "podcasts": 15
```

### TwiML Response
```bash
curl -X POST https://podcast-ivr-production.up.railway.app/webhook/ivr-main
# Should return: TwiML with 15 podcast options
```

## 📞 **Twilio Configuration (After Railway Deploys)**

Once Railway is running the new version:

1. **Go to Twilio Console**: https://console.twilio.com
2. **Phone Numbers → Active Numbers**
3. **Click your phone number**
4. **Set webhook URL**: `https://podcast-ivr-production.up.railway.app/webhook/ivr-main`
5. **Set method**: POST
6. **Save configuration**

## 🎯 **Expected Final Result**

When everything is working:
- ☎️ **Phone calls** → **15-podcast menu**
- 🎵 **Audio playback** for each podcast selection
- 📊 **Analytics tracking** for revenue attribution
- 🔄 **Auto-updates** from RSS feeds
